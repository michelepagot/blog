<p>This will be the final post here (you can now follow us on <a href="http://www.hexblog.com/">this one</a> instead), as radare has been acquired by <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/index.shtml">Hex-Rays</a>, and the radare2 project will be soon ported to ida-<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzLIG6zIIAAF7kc.jpg:large">python</a>. This has several advantages :</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining such a big software in such an old language like C is tiresome, using a high-level one will allow use to write more features in less lines of code.</li>
<li>Everyone (especially our lead-dev, pancake) enjoys Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the next few hours, we will do our best to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/apple-pulls-plug-tech-company-runs/">delete</a> all traces of the radare code base from the internet, as we no longer think that free or open-source is the best way for us to go. Closed-source will allow us to provide paying updates and bugfixes, selling formations and support, thus supporting our development expenses and fees.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll become also more credible to your management when you&rsquo;ll speak about radare2; because it has now an expensive licensing scheme, instead of being a dodgy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hippie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> free-licensed software</p>
<p>Speaking of good news, as you may be aware of, Hex-Rays creates a decompiler, and the next release will be based on <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/ESIL">ESIL</a>, adding emulation capabilities to it (a bit like <a href="http://www.idabook.com/x86emu/">x86emu</a>) allowing much more accurate an readable decompilation!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank Ilfak and the whole <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/about.shtml">Hex-rays crew</a> for hiring most of the core dev, and welcoming them in their Belgium offices!</p>
<p>Stay tuned, and see you around a beer in Lièges :)</p>
