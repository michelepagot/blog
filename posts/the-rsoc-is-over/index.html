        <p>October is over and we delayed a bit the end of the <a href="http://rada.re/rsoc/">RSoC</a> in order to get everything done for the <a href="http://radare.today/radare-0-9-8/">release</a>, and it seems that little happened as planned:</p>
<p>The RSoC advertisement was a great opportunity to get new developers interested in contributing to the project, some of them even without joining the RSoC took some points that weren&rsquo;t requested and delivered them! That&rsquo;s pretty cool, because our two <em>selected students</em> disapeared during the summer.</p>
<h2 id="abandonned-tasks">Abandonned tasks</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re a bit sad that the <a href="http://radare.today/exploring-the-database/">sdbization</a> task wasn&rsquo;t completed, since this would have been a huge improvement, both in term of performances and cool new features, like collaboration. Also, no one gave some love to the <a href="http://cloud.rada.re">web interface</a>, so it will still be an ugly PoC a bit longer.</p>
<h2 id="complete-tasks">Complete tasks</h2>
<p>Most of the tasks weren&rsquo;t completed on the test cases and documentation sides, but we hope to get things done in time for the <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/milestones/0.9.9">next release</a>, the 0.9.9.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to congratulate our 3 volunteers for their hard work and dedication. They were supposed to be the &lsquo;free&rsquo; team, but since our two <em>official</em> students left, we&rsquo;d like to pay them as if they were selected: We managed to get <strong>$2100</strong> in budget, so each of them will receive <strong>$700</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="structures-support">Structures support</h3>
<p><a href="http://libskia.so/">Skia</a> did great to implement structures support, a bit <em>à la</em> 010Editor.
<img src="/blog/images/687474703a2f2f7777772e6c6962736b69612e736f2f7075622f72322532306c696e6b65642532306c6973742e706e67.png" alt="structure">
Now with <code>r2 -nn</code> it is possible to analyze the file header structs using the <code>pf.</code>, <code>pxa</code> and other related commands.</p>
<pre><code>$ r2 -nn /path/to/bin
</code></pre><h3 id="flirt-and-yara-support">FLIRT and YARA support</h3>
<p><a href="http://failhard.org/">jfrankowski</a> did a great RSoC, and improved <a href="https://plusvic.github.io/yara/">yara</a> support in radare2, and also added the <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml">FLIRT</a> one! Currently, radare2 is only able to use existing signatures, but feel free to drop us a patch to build our own, using radare!</p>
<p>Yara3 support is almost there, but we prefer to release for a welltested yara2 version and push the upgrade in 0.9.9.</p>
<h3 id="pdb-support">PDB support</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inisider">inisider</a> implemented a standalone library to handle <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/121366">PDB</a> files, and integrated it into radare2. You can now analyse/debug PE with much more ease.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; .!rabin2 -rP test.pdb
</code></pre><h3 id="esil">ESIL</h3>
<p>Nobody took that task from the RSoC, but pancake and condret raised the bar and managed to get a working implementation of <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/ESIL">ESIL</a>, mainly tested on gameboy, brainfuck, x86 and mips. Also, pancake made a new search command to use esil expressions to perform complex conditional carving useful for forensics and data analysis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We enjoyed holding this first RSoC. We made some mikstakes, and learned a lot of things. If we won&rsquo;t get selected for a GSoC once again, be sure that the second RSoC will be better than the first one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who attended, participated, donated, supported, helped, advertised, improved and tested things. Without you, the RSoC wouldn&rsquo;t have been so productive!</p>
